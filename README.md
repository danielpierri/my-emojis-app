# my-emojis-app

## Origin

This is an app that I developed while learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
through Scrimba's Front-End Developer Career Path.

## Function

On this app, you can make a list of emojis by typing them in the white space, 
adding emojis in the beginning or the end of the list, as well as removing them as you want.
